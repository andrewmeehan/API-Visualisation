# API-Visualisation
Project for college used to visualise Github API data 
This python program utilised certain libraries like PyGithub, requests, and plotly, which may need to be installed to run correctly.
Also, the graphs only loaded in Firefox for me, Chrome would not work, which resulted in me needing to change my default browser for them to load.
I have included screenshots to show how they appear using two different github accounts.
